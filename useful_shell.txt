$_ or !$ recall last argument from previous command (these are just vim)
!^ first argument (after script/program) from previous command
!! (previous command, think yelling)
!n (command n from history)
e.g. ls a.txt b.txt
!:1 gives first argument
!:1-2 gives both arguments

sed -i '1s/^/my_line_of_text\n/' myfile # inserts my_line_of_text\n as the first line of myfile, can add a $variable in the line by using " instead of '
