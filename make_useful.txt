target: sources
<TAB> command

linking depends on .o's
compiling creates a .o that depends on the .c and all included files
Therefore if one .c changes, just need to recreate the .o file and relink
if a header changes, may need to rebuild more

Running make with no target given on the command line uses the first target in the file.

The algorithm is:
    For each source, if it is a target in the Makefile, then process recursively
    Then
        If some source does not exist, error
        If some source is newer than the target, (or target DNE)
        run shell command.
